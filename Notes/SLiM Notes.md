#### Wright-Fisher Model Background

_Muirhead 2016_: WF model is 'a mathematical description of the random fluctuations of allele frequency due to sampling in a finite population'

__General Assumptions__
* Random mating
* Discrete generations
* hermaphroditic individuals
* no selective diffs among genotype at locus

### Slim is based on Wright-Fisher model

Basic Assumptions:
- generations are non-overlapping, discrete
- Prob. of an individual being chosen as a parent for a child in next gen. is proportional to the individual's fitness
- individuals are diploid
- offspring are generated by recomb of parental chromosomes w/ additional mutations

Eidos Language Interacts w/ SLiM

### SLiM Conceptual Overview

Individual based Model:
* every individual is simulated explicitly
* Each individual is an instance of the `Individual` class

At most basic level, individuals are born and die, and in between they find mates and reproduce (sexual or cloning)

**_Each Individual has 2 homologous chromosomes (diploid)

- Each of the 2 genomes in each individual is an instance of the `Genome` class
- Genome = container that holds mutations
- By default, genomes are 'empty' -> no mutations or information
- Mutations are modifications that lay on top of this empty state
- __At beginning of simulaton, all genomes have a relative fitness of 1.0
- Can start with any mutational load, and load VCF or MS files

Most commonly, simulation begins after a "burn-in" period that establishes an equilibrium level of diversity through mutation-selection-migration balance

**In general, if two mutations are segregating at a given base position, there are effectively three alleles in the population at that base position: the first mutation, the second mutation, and what you could think of as the “wild-type allele” represented by the absence of either of those mutations**

In SLiM, chromosomes contain mutations layered on top of the empty "wild type"

_In SLiM, the 'wild type" state of the organism of study is represented simply by a lack of mutations, by empty chromosomes_
